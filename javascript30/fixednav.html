        My five years' old daughter Mini cannot live without chattering. I
        really believe that in all her life she has not wasted a minute in
        silence. Her mother is often vexed at this, and would stop her prattle,
        but I would not. To see Mini quiet is unnatural, and I cannot bear it
        long. And so my own talk with her is always lively.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, for instance, when I was in the midst of the seventeenth
        chapter of my new novel, my little Mini stole into the room, and putting
        her hand into mine, said: "Father! Ramdayal the doorkeeper calls a crow
        a krow! He doesn't know anything, does he?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I could explain to her the differences of language in this world,
        she was embarked on the full tide of another subject. "What do you
        think, Father? Bhola says there is an elephant in the clouds, blowing
        water out of his trunk, and that is why it rains!"
      </p>

      <p>
        And then, darting off anew, while I sat still making ready some reply to
        this last saying, "Father! what relation is Mother to you?"
      </p>

        class="align-left slide-in"
      />

      <p>
        "My dear little sister in the law!" I murmured involuntarily to myself,
        but with a grave face contrived to answer: "Go and play with Bhola,
        Mini! I am busy!"
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        The window of my room overlooks the road. The child had seated herself
        at my feet near my table, and was playing softly, drumming on her knees.
        I was hard at work on my seventeenth chapter, where Protrap Singh, the
        hero, had just caught Kanchanlata, the heroine, in his arms, and was
        about to escape with her by the third story window of the castle, when
        all of a sudden Mini left her play, and ran to the window, crying, "A
        Kabuliwallah! a Kabuliwallah!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure enough in the street below was a Kabuliwallah, passing slowly
        along. He wore the loose soiled clothing of his people, with a tall
        turban; there was a bag on his back, and he carried boxes of grapes in
        his hand.
      </p>

      <img
        src="../media/50758583586_32091d2fda_w.jpg"
        class="align-right slide-in"
      />
      <p>
        I cannot tell what were my daughter's feelings at the sight of this man,
        but she began to call him loudly. "Ah!"" I thought, "he will come in,
        and my seventeenth chapter will never be finished!" At which exact
        moment the Kabuliwallah turned, and looked up at the child. When she saw
        this, overcome by terror, she fled to her mother's protection, and
        disappeared. She had a blind belief that inside the bag, which the big
        man carried, there were perhaps two or three other children like
        herself. The pedlar meanwhile entered my doorway, and greeted me with a
        smiling face.
      </p>

      <p>
        So precarious was the position of my hero and my heroine, that my first
        impulse was to stop and buy something, since the man had been called. I
        made some small purchases, and a conversation began about Abdur Rahman,
        the Russians, the English, and the Frontier Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he was about to leave, he asked: "And where is the little girl, sir?"
      </p>
      <p>
        And I, thinking that Mini must get rid of her false fear, had her
        brought out.
      </p>
      <p>
        She stood by my chair, and looked at the Kabuliwallah and his bag. He
        offered her nuts and raisins, but she would not be tempted, and only
        clung the closer to me, with all her doubts increased.
      </p>

      <p>This was their first meeting.</p>
